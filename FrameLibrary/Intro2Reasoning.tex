\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item LLMs have transformed artificial intelligence, extending beyond traditional NLP.
Formal logic systems but struggled with real-world complexity.
Data-driven models, particularly LLMs, learn knowledge and reasoning from data.
Recent advancements in models like OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek-R1 highlight the interest in enhancing logical thinking within LLMs.
The transition from programmed logic to learned reasoning represents a fundamental change in AI.
LLMs' apparent ability to perform tasks requiring thought processes suggests a new avenue for human-like cognition.
Successful models in this area have likely fueled further AI research investment.
Robust reasoning in LLMs could revolutionize domains requiring accuracy and verifiability, such as legal analysis and scientific discovery.
Reasoning in AI involves applying structured rules to derive conclusions.
In LLMs, reasoning integrates natural language understanding with structured inferences, enabling multi-step deduction and abstraction.
This integration improves the interpretability and reliability of LLM outputs.
Structured inference allows LLMs to generalize more effectively to novel scenarios.
This capability signifies a step beyond mere pattern recognition, hinting at an emergent capacity for logical thought.
Multi-step thought processes enhance the clarity and trustworthiness of LLM outcomes.
This feature is crucial for deploying LLMs in complex and sensitive areas.
