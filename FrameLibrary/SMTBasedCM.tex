\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{SMT Based Conversational Modeling - Introduction}
The SMT-based method, on the other hand, is generative. Basically it treats the response generation as a translation problem, in which the model is trained on a parallel corpus of post-response pairs

\begin{frame}{Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Responses are related to the post and are not semantically equivalent as in the case of translation
	\item A single post may receive several responses
\end{itemize}
