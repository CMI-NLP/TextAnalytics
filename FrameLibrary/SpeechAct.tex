    We could also  use Speech Act to make the conversation more robust and human-like by using them as features.
    \vspace{3mm}

    Each utterance in a dialog is closely related to an action. Speech acts refer to the various functions that language can perform beyond conveying information
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Assertives}: Statements that convey information.
\item \textbf{Directives}: Commands or requests.
\item \textbf{Commissives}: Promises, commitments.
\item \textbf{Expressives}: Expressions of emotion or attitude.
\item \textbf{Declarations}: Changes the state of affairs
\item \textbf{Acknowledgements}

    \end{itemize}

    Thus speech act expresses an important component of the intention of the spoken/written sentences

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Locutionary act}
            This basic level of communication focuses on the literal meaning conveyed by the words themselves

    \begin{block}{Examples}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Coveys directly the  literal meaning
        \item Doesn't involve intention, context, or interpretation

      \item Essential for building more complex speech acts.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  \verb|The sky is blue| - simple statement
            \item \verb|What time is it?| - question $\smile$
            \item \verb|Stop| - commands
            \item \verb|Congratulations|- Exclamations
            \item \verb|I promise|- Performatives
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{illocutionary act}

    Each of these sentences not only conveys information but also performs a particular illocutionary act, such as expressing a belief, making a request, committing to an action, expressing emotions, or making a declaration.
    \begin{block}{Examples}
     \begin{itemize}
         \item \verb|I believe that the sky is blue |- assertive
         \item  \verb|Please pass the salt| - Directive
         \item \verb|I promise to meet you at 5 pm| - Commissive
         \item \verb|Congratulations on your promotion! |- Expressive
         \item  \verb|I declare this meeting adjourned |- Declarative
     \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\begin{frame}{Grounding}
    Any dialog is not an independent set of sentences. Dialogs happen on a \textbf{\underline{common ground}}. The speakers often perform ground Grounding act by acknowledging that the hearer has understood the speaker
